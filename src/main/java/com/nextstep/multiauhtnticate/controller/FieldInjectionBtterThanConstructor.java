//    onstructor injection is better because it ensures that all the required parts (dependencies) are given to an object when it’s created.
//
//    Imagine you’re making a cake, and the constructor is like your recipe that lists all the ingredients you need before you start baking.
//    If something is missing, the recipe will tell you right away, so you don’t start without it.
//    This way, the cake always has everything it needs to turn out well.
//    With field injection, it’s like starting to bake the cake but waiting for someone to randomly bring ingredients later – you might forget something, and the cake could fail.
//    Constructor injection helps keep everything organized and ensures no missing pieces from the start.
//    It also makes testing easier, like checking if the ingredients are correct before baking the cake.
//    Overall, it keeps the process cleaner, simpler, and less likely to break.



//
//    Here’s a comparison explaining why field injection is not better and constructor injection is better, in simple programming terms:
//
//    Why Field Injection is Not Better:
//    Hidden Dependencies: In field injection, dependencies are set "behind the scenes" by the framework, making it hard to see what the class needs just by looking at the code.
//    NullPointerException Risk: If the framework fails to initialize the field (e.g., during testing), your code can break with null values.
//    Harder to Test: You can’t easily inject mock dependencies for unit testing without relying on the Spring framework.
//    Immutability Issues: Fields can be changed after the object is created, which can lead to bugs if the dependency is accidentally replaced.
//    Why Constructor Injection is Better:
//    Explicit Dependencies: All required dependencies are passed through the constructor, so it's clear what the class needs to work.
//    No Null Dependencies: The object cannot be created without its dependencies, ensuring everything is properly initialized.
//    Easier to Test: You can create an instance of the class and inject mock objects directly in your unit tests without relying on the framework.
//    Promotes Immutability: Dependencies are typically declared as final in constructor injection, ensuring they cannot be modified after the object is created.
//    Improved Maintainability: If someone else reads your code, they can instantly see the required dependencies in the constructor.
//    Summary:
//    Field Injection = hidden, risky, and hard to test.
//    Constructor Injection = clear, safe, and test-friendly.
