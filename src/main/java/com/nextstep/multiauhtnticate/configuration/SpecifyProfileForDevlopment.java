public class SpecifyProfileForDevlopment {
//    The SpecifyProfileForDevelopment class in Spring Boot likely serves to set or manage a
//        specific profile for development purposes. Profiles in Spring Boot allow you to
//    define different configurations (e.g., properties, beans) for different environments like
//    development, testing, or production. This class might configure the application to use a
//"dev" profile to load development-specific settings, such as in application-dev.properties.
//    Using profiles helps streamline environment-specific behavior without changing code. It
//    is particularly useful for toggling debug-level logs, mock data sources, or sandbox APIs
//    during development.


//    Yes, you are correct! The functionality of specifying a profile for development can be
//    achieved by setting the spring.profiles.active property. Here's a brief explanation:
//
//    Purpose: The spring.profiles.active property is used to activate a specific profile, such
//    as "dev," "test," or "prod."
//
//    Usage: You can set it in the application.properties or application.yml file, or pass it
//    as a command-line argument:
//
//    Copy code
//    spring.profiles.active=dev
//    Effect: When a profile is active, Spring Boot loads the corresponding configuration file
//            (e.g., application-dev.properties).
//
//    Alternative: A dedicated class like SpecifyProfileForDevelopment can encapsulate logic to
//        set a profile programmatically or perform additional setup.
//
//    Recommendation: For most cases, setting spring.profiles.active in properties or via
//    environment variables suffices, making a separate class unnecessary unless there are
//            additional custom needs.
