//    The Spring Container is the core of the Spring Framework, responsible for creating,
//    managing, and configuring beans (Java objects). It uses the Inversion of Control (IoC)
//    principle to handle object lifecycle, dependencies, and scopes. In Spring Boot, the
//    container is automatically initialized when the application starts, loading beans from the
//    application context. Developers use it to manage dependencies and business logic by annotating
//    classes with Spring annotations like @Component, @Service, or @Repository.
