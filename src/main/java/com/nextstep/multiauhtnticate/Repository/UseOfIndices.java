//    Yes, indexes will work internally when you define them in your database schema, and they
//    are automatically used by the database management system (DBMS) when executing queries.
//    Here's a breakdown of how it works:
//
//            1. What Happens When You Define an Index in JPA?
//    In your AddBook entity, you've defined an index on the id column as follows:
//
//    java
//    Copy code
//    @Table(name = "add_book", indexes = {
//            @Index(name = "index_add_book_id", columnList = "id")
//    })
//    This tells the database to create an index on the id column of the add_book table. When the
//    database executes queries that involve the id field (e.g., searching for a record by id),
//    it will use this index for faster lookups, rather than scanning the entire table.
//
//2. How Indexes Improve Query Performance
//    Indexes are used by the database's query optimizer to speed up data retrieval. Specifically:
//
//    For equality-based queries: If you query by the id field (e.g., SELECT * FROM add_book
//            WHERE id = ?), the database uses the index on id to directly locate the row, which
//    is much faster than performing a full table scan.
//
//    Example:
//
//    java
//    Copy code
//    @Query("SELECT b FROM AddBook b WHERE b.id = :id")
//    public Optional<AddBook> findByIdExists(@Param("id") String id);
//    Since id is indexed, this query will be executed quickly using the index rather than
//    scanning all the rows in the add_book table.
//
//    For range queries: If you perform queries that involve ranges (e.g., BETWEEN or >, <), the
//    index can also optimize these operations by helping the database quickly narrow down the
//        range.
//
//    For sorting: If your query involves sorting by the indexed column (e.g., ORDER BY id), the
//    database can retrieve the rows in sorted order directly from the index, avoiding a separate
//    sorting step.
//
//            3. Automatic Index Usage by the DBMS
//    When you define an index in your JPA annotations (or in your database schema directly), the
//    database will automatically decide when and how to use the index, depending on the type of
//    query being executed. This is handled by the database's query optimizer.
//
//    For simple queries, like SELECT * FROM add_book WHERE id = :id, the DBMS will automatically
//    use the index to find the record more efficiently.
//    For more complex queries (e.g., joins or filtering on multiple columns), the DBMS may decide
//    whether using the index is beneficial based on the query's structure and the data distribution.
//            4. How to Ensure Indexes are Being Used
//    If you want to verify that the index is being used for a query, you can:
//
//    Use an explain plan: Most database systems support an EXPLAIN statement (or similar) to
//    show how a query is executed, including whether indexes are being used. For example:
//
//    sql
//    Copy code
//    EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM add_book WHERE id = 'someId';
//    This will give you insight into whether the query is using the index or performing a full
//    table scan.
//
//    Check the query execution plan: Some database management systems provide query execution
//    plans that show how queries are executed and whether indexes are used. These plans are
//    useful for debugging performance issues and ensuring that indexes are being leveraged
//        effectively.
//
//5. Additional Considerations
//    While indexes are useful for speeding up query execution, they come with some trade-offs:
//
//    Write Performance: Indexes can slow down insert, update, and delete operations because the
//    index must be updated whenever the data changes. However, this is typically less of a concern for read-heavy applications.
//
//    Storage: Indexes consume additional storage on disk. If you create too many indexes, it
//    could lead to increased storage requirements.
//
//    Index Maintenance: Over time, indexes can become fragmented, which might degrade
//    performance. You should periodically monitor and optimize your indexes as part of routine database maintenance.
//
//    Conclusion
//    When you define an index, the database internally uses it to optimize queries that filter,
//    sort, or join on the indexed columns. The index will improve read operations by reducing
//    the number of rows the database needs to scan. You don’t need to manually tell the database
//    to use the index—it's handled automatically by the DBMS. However, for more complex queries or
//    to optimize performance further, you might need to experiment with adding indexes on other
//    columns or analyzing the query execution plans.
