//    In the context of your Spring Boot application configuration, you are using HikariCP for connection pooling to manage connections to your PostgreSQL database. Here's a simple breakdown of how it's set up and why each part of the configuration is important:
//
//    Key Properties in Your Configuration:
//    spring.datasource.hikari.pool-name:
//
//    What it does: This sets the name of the connection pool. Here, it's named HikariCP.
//    Why it's necessary: Naming the pool helps in identifying and managing multiple connection pools in larger applications.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size:
//
//    What it does: This sets the maximum number of connections in the pool. In your case, it’s set to 10.
//    Why it's necessary: Limiting the number of connections ensures that your database isn’t overwhelmed with too many simultaneous connections, which can degrade performance. By setting this to 10, you allow up to 10 concurrent connections at a time to your database.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.minimum-idle:
//
//    What it does: This specifies the minimum number of idle connections to maintain in the pool. You’ve set it to 5.
//    Why it's necessary: This ensures there are always a few idle connections available for immediate use, without needing to create new connections from scratch.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout:
//
//    What it does: This sets how long a connection can remain idle before it’s closed. In your case, it's set to 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
//    Why it's necessary: Idle connections consume resources, so this setting ensures that unused connections are closed after a certain time, freeing up resources.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime:
//
//    What it does: This specifies how long a connection can live before it’s considered expired and needs to be replaced. You’ve set it to 30 minutes (1,800,000 milliseconds).
//    Why it's necessary: Connections that live too long might run into issues like network timeouts or database server problems. Setting this ensures connections are replaced after a set period to maintain fresh, reliable connections.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout:
//
//    What it does: This defines how long the application will wait to obtain a connection from the pool before timing out. You’ve set it to 30,000 milliseconds (30 seconds).
//    Why it's necessary: If the pool is exhausted (all connections are in use), this setting prevents the application from hanging indefinitely while waiting for a connection. If no connection is available within 30 seconds, an error is thrown.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.validation-timeout:
//
//    What it does: This setting defines how long to wait for a connection to be validated before it’s considered invalid. In your case, it’s set to 5 seconds (5,000 milliseconds).
//    Why it's necessary: When a connection is retrieved from the pool, it may need to be checked to ensure it’s still valid. This setting ensures the validation process doesn’t hang for too long.
//    spring.datasource.hikari.leak-detection-threshold:
//
//    What it does: This property helps detect connections that were opened but not closed properly. You’ve set it to 15 seconds.
//    Why it's necessary: If a connection is not closed after 15 seconds, it's considered a "leak" and a warning is logged. This helps identify and fix issues where connections are not being closed, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
//    Summary of Why Connection Pooling Is Necessary in Your Configuration:
//    Efficiency: By using HikariCP, you avoid the overhead of opening and closing database connections repeatedly, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
//            Scalability: Your application can handle a high number of concurrent users without exhausting the database’s available connections, thanks to connection pooling. It efficiently manages the available pool size (max 10 connections, with a minimum of 5 idle connections).
//    Resource Management: Settings like idle-timeout and max-lifetime ensure that your connections are properly cleaned up, preventing unused connections from occupying resources unnecessarily.
//            Reliability: With validation-timeout and leak-detection-threshold, you ensure that only valid, properly closed connections are used, reducing the risk of errors in your application.
//    In short, connection pooling with HikariCP improves the performance, stability, and scalability of your application by managing database connections more efficiently. It helps to avoid performance bottlenecks and resource leaks, ensuring smooth operation even under high loads.
